#### Pokémon

**Birthed in the early 90’s the Pokémon franchise is a household name in almost all parts of the world. This isn’t an easily maintained position when put up against the test of time and the flooding of new additions coming to our screens and handhelds.**

Pokémon didn’t start off as a video game or manga as many would assume, the first iteration of Pokémon was in card form. The first of which printed in the October of 1996. This is relevant because their very creation is stemmed in typography and design. When looking at cards of this RPG genre we can typically see typography that fits the specific card type. This is usually done in ways that compliment the elemental category of your chosen character. For instance, a water type Pokémon’s typography could have a high contrast and heavy weighted font, reminiscent of the typical non uniform flow and ebb of the liquid itself.

The cards all have the same rear, a red and white poke-ball encompassed by tendrils of wind, emulating the motion of being thrown through the air. The colours we see used repeatedly in the franchise are blue and yellow, imbuing the audience with feelings of trust, optimism, and strength. These three things are key components in what Pokémon would have players believe the best trainers possess. The colours used are such that, before even picking the game or card up, you’re mentally geared towards completing the task or at the very least believing it is possible for you to do so.

The title of Pokémon itself has a very interesting font. It’s certainly novelty, however the colour scheme (particularly the blue) paired with the serifs seem to give it an air of authority. A title that doesn’t take itself too seriously but its also far from a joke. This is reflective of the game itself, sure it’s a game that is based on a cartoon world with pocket monsters. But equally it’s a game about a young boy embarking on a journey way bigger than he is, having to face pivotal decisions that could irreparably change the world he lives in for the worst.

The spacing between letters doesn’t exist, except for the kerning between the “P” and “O” which has more space than the rest of the characters, each character encroaches into the next. This gives the reader a sense of seamlessness or unification or on the contrary it could be a representation of a young man who doesn’t fit in with his current world and as a result embarks on a journey. Another example of this theory is that the baseline in the title is completely ignored. The letters that should sit on it are below it and vice versa. This lens more credence to the idea of not fitting in with current surroundings.

For a game that I’ve played for so many years it was interesting to go back and look at the things I was so eager to look past in my haste to play.

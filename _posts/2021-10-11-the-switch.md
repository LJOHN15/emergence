### This piece will be about the first things I noticed on my arrival to a new place in comparison to the place I had just left.

My first tangible experience of the switch was my first morning in Milton Keynes. I opened my eyes and there was silence, save maybe for a few birds sharing their song and the breeze encompassing the treetops with audible the absence of anything else. Not the chatter I was used to from the streets below, not the sound of horns and traffic nor the sounds of sirens, a sound that had long since become unnoticed to my ears.

I could hear the unfamiliar creaks of this new house, the dull thrum and drips of the heating system I hadn't grown accustomed to yet. While all of this felt new, it didn't feel uncertain. Perhaps this was my first inkling in knowing I had made a good choice in coming. The birds sang from a different song sheet in this new place. Their warbles and trills culminating in a way I hadn't before experienced.

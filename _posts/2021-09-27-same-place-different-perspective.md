#### Off To A Good Start?

To spend a lifetime in place, just to leave one Summer is no easy feat, especially when you have no real idea of what lies beyond your limited horizon. Sometimes though, our need for growth outweighs the space we have to attain it. Sometimes the thought of our stagnation quells the uncertainty of changing our surroundings. Sometimes the idea of what could be over the horizon is so much more satiating than what our current view has to offer.

I caught a late train up to Milton Keynes, it had been raining and cold. On my person was a phone with no data, minutes or texts. a faltering battery of 6% and no real idea of how to get to my new home from the train station, a great start by anyone's analysis. To my credit I had the presence of mind to take screenshots of the route home, the issue with this being, in darkness and a new place, its hard to tell where you are in relation to what you see on a map.

With rain streaks and perseverance etched upon my face, an eerie sense of equanimity (whilst utterly unwarranted) also befell my being. imbuing me with pseudo confidence I would need to withstand this treacherous test of guile and resilience. This aforementioned perseverance and equanimity dissipated as soon as I reached "The Teardrops" A set of three man made lakes in a gargantuan parkland setting. A place undeniably picturesque by day and yet also somehow a descent into a midge infested hell of darkness and squalor by night. Please be reminded I have just left the inner sanctum of London. We know nothing of wildlife save for a few pigeons rats and foxes.

This lake was deceptively diminutive on google maps, in the same way that expecting a cute French bulldog for Christmas and in lieu receiving a Dire Wolf from the forests of Winterfell itself instead would be a shock. However this was far from the biggest issue, no. The biggest issue was that I could see nothing of these huge three bodies of water. Sure, I could hear the break from the lakes tide, hitting the banks. Undoubtedly, I could smell the unmistakeable scent of water and the plant life that frequents it. and yet visually? I had nothing, not a glint of moonlight on the surface, not a tell-tale ripple of movement, nothing. We'll revisit The Teardrops in a later article. 

Once I finally figured out the orientation of the screenshot was incorrect I managed to find myself heading back towards civilization. Honestly, I got lucky on that journey. I contemplated turning back multiple times, maybe I should have. But managing to find my way home in an unfamiliar place without the use of technology filled me with a sense of confidence and independence I hadn't yet experienced.

I cant explain how I felt when I finally saw a road I recognised. Its like all the expended energy, mental and physical was reimbursed with interest. I was invigored, interestingly the mishaps of the night actually catalysed an exploratory side of my character that was previously dormant. I went to bed that night excited at the prospects of the future and this place I had found myself in.

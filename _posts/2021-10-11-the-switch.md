#### The Adjustment To New Surroundings

My first tangible experience of the switch happened on my first morning in Milton Keynes. I opened my eyes and there was silence, save maybe for a few birds sharing their song and the breeze encompassing the treetops with audible the absence of anything else. Not the chatter I was used to from the streets below, not the sound of horns and traffic nor the sounds of sirens, a sound that had long since become unnoticed to my ears. The silence was deafening, it was all I could hear. I couldn't remember the last time I had this much space to hear my thoughts in clarity. The silence began to subside, though still present, my ears adjusted to hearing the subtle sounds they had previously overlooked.

I could hear the unfamiliar creaks of this new house, the dull thrum and drips of the heating system I hadn't grown accustomed to yet. While all of this felt new, it didn't feel uncertain. Perhaps this was my first inkling in knowing I had made a good choice in coming. The birds sang from a different song sheet in this new place. Their warbles and trills culminating in a way I hadn't before experienced. The air smelt and tasted different and my garden became my new sanctuary, the aircraft in the sky turned from police helicopters searching for suspect to BAE Hawks practising air superiority manoeuvres for their next air show.

I was lucky in the way that my house was 3 minutes from Furzton Lake, a gorgeous body of water with a great walking route surrounding it. The friendliness of the locals stood out to me, every other interaction was a smile or greeting. In London everyone so buried in their own worlds, maybe in an unfriendly way or maybe in a way of protecting their sanity in a world of constantly moving and sometimes abrasive parts. Furzton Lake became a frequented spot of mine, it brought me peace.

It wasn't all rainbows and giggles though, if there are two things that London has the last say in, its food and transport. Adjusting to the food options in MK wasn't easy, I missed the accessibility of shops and food in London. I had grown up with 24/7 shops dotted all around. Here, you're lucky if a shop is still open after 7pm. The first culture shock was when I ordered a battered sausage and chips. When my food arrived there was a large polystyrene cup in tow. I couldn't remember ordering a drink & even if I had, why would they send it to me in this tub? I opened it, my excitement building while I unravelled the cling film, lips smacking in anticipation, imagining they had somehow given me a freebie. Curry sauce... It was curry sauce... What even is curry sauce? Its either a curry or a sauce, not both! and why would I want this on my chips? I digress, but the key take away here is they give out curry sauce for free seemingly anywhere North of London, who knew?!

## Alien Isolation

Isolation, a term synonamous with seperation and an independent exsistence. This game is the ultimate expression of human seclusion. You are thrust into the interstellar expanse of space, aboard a ship dead in the water. Your team mysteriously disappear throughout a period of a few days and with nowhere to go apart from the unforgiving vaccum of space, its your job as the highest ranking officer to find out where they are. The game is seeped in mystery without multiple high tension moments made for you to straddle the edge of your seat, this is aswell as deeply atmospheric.
